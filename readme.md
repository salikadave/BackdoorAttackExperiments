Backdoor Attack

Goal: Implement backdoor attack

Dataset: CIFAR-10

Model Architecture: ResNet-18

Introduction to backdoor attacks:

BadNets: Identifying Vulnerabilities in the Machine Learning Model Supply Chain (Gu 2017)

Overall procedure:

1. Load in the dataset

2. Create a backdoor pattern

3. Create backdoor training samples and backdoor test samples

4. Load in the model architecture

5. Insert the backdoor training samples into the training set

6. Perform training (same as previous)

7. Evaluate clean test accuracy and attack success rate

TO DO:

1. Implement a backdoor pattern

2. Poison the training set

3. Modify the configurations: poisoning rate (250 images to 1500 images) OR perturbation size (from 0 to 1)

Report:

1. Attack success rate and clean test accuracy for basic configuration

2. Attack success rate versus poisoning rate or perturbation size

Additional task:

(TBD) Implement the patch replacement backdoor pattern
